## About
Prodchain is blockchain solution for consumers to verify goods' manufacturer,
composition and chain of production.

Prodchain's goals are:
- create open market, where
sellers' and manufacturers' statements about their products can be proved by global community.  

Stated above goals can be achieved through:
- storing actions to transfer, transform or generate goods or their components in transactions
- proofing transactions through cryptographic algorithms
- collecting blocks of transactions in blockchain
